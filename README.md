## About

This is a multi-purpose living documentation about principles, pragmatic metodologies, coding-style guides, technical useful books and articles, best practices/conventions to be a reference in the daily work for the geek guys in [Adesis Netlife][adesis], and of course, to the world

## Our Zen

- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea
- Explicit is better than implicit
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious (optimal) way to do it (Occam's razor)
- Avoid doing things you maybe could not use (YAGNI) (maybe are not needed)
- Simple is better than complex (KISS)
- Avoid redundancy and boilerplate code (DRY)
- Sparse is better than dense, avoid "God Objects" (single reponsability principle)
- Readability always matters, make it comprehesive as possible
- If it's hard to test, you will probably need to rethink the implementation
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules (see below for *exceptions* and *special cases*)
- Although practicality beats purity
- Errors should never pass silently
- Now is better than never
- Continous learning is a constant (which is always changing)
- Keep in mind "reutility" when you're coding
- There is no an generic solution to all the problems (each problem should be **solved once**)
- If something do not exists, it could be a good time to doing it (DIY)
- We adopt the change, because it's normal ( and **not** because it is the *norm* )

## Manifiesto

- We defende the proper and more competent way to solve a problem
- Humility is a great value ([Law of Jante][jante]) (which applies *both ways*)
- We seek to use the proper pattern to solve recurrent problems
- We avoid anti-patterns, but if we must use it, it will be an exceptional solution (although this **may break** the *rules*)
- We enjoy TDD, but we love BDD
- We're social guys, we enjoy pair programming
- We try to the be constantly a pragmatic programmer (and not an dogmatic one)
