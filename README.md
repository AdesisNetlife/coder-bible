## About

This is a multi-purpose living documentation about principles, pragmatic metodologies, coding-style guide, best practices and conventions to be a reference in our daily work to the geek guys in [Adesis Netlife][adesis], helping you to follow the shared conventions and helping you to be a pragmatic programmer

## Our Zen

- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea
- Explicit is better than implicit, we hate speculation
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it (Occam's razor)
- Avoid doing things you maybe could not use (YAGNI)
- Simple is better than complex (KISS)
- Avoid redundancy and boilerplate code (DRY)
- Sparse is better than dense, avoid "God Objects" (single reponsability principle)
- Readability always matters, make it comprehesive
- If it's hard to test, you will probably need to rethink the implementation
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules
- Although practicality beats purity
- Errors should never pass silently
- Now is better than never
- Continous learning is a constant
- Keep in mind "reutility" when you're coding
- There is no an generic solution to all the problems
- If something do not exists, it could be a good time to doing it (DIY)

## Our Values

- We defende the proper and more compotent way to solve a problem
- Humility is a great value ([Law of Jante][jante])
- We seek to use the proper pattern to solve recurrent problems
- We avoid anti-patterns, but if we must use it, it will be an exceptional solution
- We enjoy TDD, but we love BDD
- We try to the be a permanent pragmatic programmer
- We avoid making "shit"
